# HCA-Healthcare-Challenge
Part of our team project for the AIS SCLC National Challenge, where we earned 2nd place! Using data provided by HCA Healthcare, we developed a web application to help locate managers and supervisors during a national disaster. This repository contains the data analysis and backend components of the completed project.
